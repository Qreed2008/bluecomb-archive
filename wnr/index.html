      This is the Windows Never Released archive. Essentially, it is made-up versions of Windows, usually put together in a video. There's a lot that goes into these: you need the image, the startup and shutdown sounds it uses (and occasionally some others), sometimes a version list if a video is being made, and occasionally some desktop concepts. All of these types of materials from many different creators are archived here.<br><br>
