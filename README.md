Archive of a bunch of stuff that I feel like archiving

Yes, all links here are on Internet Archive (or Wayback, which is owned by the same group so it kinda counts). I do not have really anywhere else to conveniently put it.

software/misc/webdumps part is more like a collection since some of the archive aren't my own Wayback saves
