Welcome to bluecomb's Archive, where I (and contributors) have archives a bunch of stuff that I care about. If you want to be a contributor, the you can <a href="https://discord.gg/N4rStnnVPG">click here to go to the Discord server</a>.<br><br>
      <a href="wnr" class="fo">Windows Never Released</a> - WNR archives of many types, from version lists to whole videos.<br>
      <a href="television" class="fo">TV archive</a> - Basically anything but whole shows. The most prominent example would be the ads archive.<br>
      <a href="logos" class="fo">Logos</a> - Logos, images and videos, maybe a Flash animation here and there (*cough cough* TCF *cough cough*)<br>
      <a href="software" class="fo">Software</a> - The one archive that persists between all supergroup versions. I'll never let go, probably.<br>
      <a href="screenshot" class="fo">Software screenshot</a> - The original form was only bootscreens, but why not widen the range? (this section is just my TOSSP alt project, like RectifyTOSSP but more)<br>
      <a href="memetemp" class="fo">Meme templates and whatever</a> - Self-explanatory. It seems like it should be in Misc, but it's not.<br>
      <a href="misc" class="fo">Misc</a> - Miscellaneous, from random YT videos to what's left of supergroup v1.<br>
